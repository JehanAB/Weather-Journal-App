## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

the testing functions are unfortunately not provided for this version. 

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

the application has a server side so if you want to launch it on a live shared hosting make sure it is one that support backend server.

eg: the application will not work on shared hosting that runs the application from the public_html folder directly. Rather use a webhosting like digital ocan or netlify if you want a free host that supports the backend.
